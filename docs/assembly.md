<h2>Assembly Instructions</h2>

<b>WARNING: I am still working on assembly instructions...</b>

<h3>Lower Body</h3>

Push both N20 100 rpm motors into Wheel Motors.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_3700.JPEG" alt="Wheel Motor" width=600>

Insert Wheel Motor assembly into Track Support Left. Secure with Motor Lock Left and a M2.6 x 6mm screw.  I like to make sure
positive (+) end of battery is on top.  It makes it easier for soldering later.

Insert Wheel Idler on other end of Track Support Left and secure with M2.6 x 8mm screws.  Make sure screws are loose enough
for idler wheel to rotate freely.

Insert 2 Track Roller Uppers and 2 Track Roller Lowers onto Track Support Left and secure with M2.6 x 6mm screws.  Make sure
that all rollers can rotate freely.

Repeat same steps for Track Support Right.

Attach Lower Frame between left and right track supports and secure with M2.6 x 8mm screws.  Ensure that the wire channel faces towards
the rear with the N20 100 rpm motors.

Insert the 12.5mm slip ring into the Slip Ring Lock.  

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_3705.JPEG" alt="Slip Ring" width=600>

Assemble the Track Support and Lower Body.  Push the wires of the slip ring through from the bottom and secure the
slip ring with M2.6 x 8mm screws. Make sure the lower cab can freely rotate from the track support assembly.

Route a pair of wires to each motor.  Cut to length and solder wires to motors.

Push a N20 100 rpm motor into Main Boom Holder and press Pinion Gear on other side.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_3709.JPEG" alt="Slip Ring" width=600>

Attach Main Boom Holder to base with M2.6 x 8mm screws.  Attach JST-XH connector to 80mm of wire and solder to
swivel motor.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_3713.JPEG" alt="Slip Ring" width=600>

Attach circuit board to lower body with M2.6 x 6mm screws.  Solder connection for left/right motor from swivel ring
and attach to circuit board.  Attach swivel motor to circuit board. 

Attach seat to lower body with M2.6 x 6mm screw.

Install TPU tracks.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_3728.JPEG" alt="Lower Body" width=600>

You should be able to power on, connect XBox/PS controller, and verify operation of tracks and swivel.
Remember, to operate tracks, you must be in drive mode.  To switch out of drive mode, press in on the left joystick.
Then you will be able to operate swivel (and boom when finally connected).

<h3>Boom and Dipper Arms</h3>

Attach boom to dipper with M2.6 x 6mm screws.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_3731.JPEG" alt="Boom Arm" width=600>

Attach JST-XH connectors to the following length of wires:

* Boom - 100mm
* Dipper - 100mm
* Bucket - 150mm
* Claw - 200mm (<b>Optional</b> - only if doing the Claw option)

I like to label my wires.  I use a label maker and then cover it with transparent Heat Shrink Tubing.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_3729.JPEG" alt="Motor Wires" width=600>

Route the Dipper, Bucket, and Claw (optional) wires into the boom as dipper as shown.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_3732.JPEG" alt="Boom Wires" width=600>

Press M4 hex nut into boom shaft and both dipper shafts.  Make sure that they are fully seated and the center of the nut
is in the center of shaft.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_3714.JPEG" alt="Motor Shaft" width=600>

Insert N20 100rpm motor into each Swivel Motor and secure with Swivel Motor Lock.  Hand screw together shafts and swivel.

Attach dipper motor and bucket motor with M2.6 x 6mm screws.  Ensure that screws are not too tight that they bind
the motor.  I like to cut off the tip of the screw to remove the point that can cause binding.

Solder motor wires to motors. Leave bucket motor wire for now.

Attach Bucket Swing Arm and Bucket Push Link to dipper with M2.6 x 6mm screws.

Attach boom/dipper arm to cab base with Motor Swivel and M2.6 x 6mm screw.  Attach boom motor to cab base and boom arm.

<h3>Bucket (Option 1)</h3>

Attach Bucket to Bucket Swing Arm and Bucket Push Link with M2.6 x 6mm and M2.6 x 8mm screws.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_3734.JPEG" alt="Bucket" width=600>


<h3>Claw (Option 2)</h3>

Insert Claw Gear into Gear Retention with small end of Claw Gear facing inwards.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_3720.JPEG" alt="Claw Gear" width=600>

Turn over and attach Claw Servo Holder with M2.6 x 6mm screws.  Ensure that gear retention ring can still rotate freely.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_3721.JPEG" alt="Claw Base" width=600>

Shorten wires on ONE SIDE of 6mm or 6.5mm slip to 50mm long.  I like to shorten the side where the wires are on
the outside of the slip ring.  We only need 3 wires.  Clip of extra wires so they are not in the way.  I like to
use the Black, Red, and Yellow wires, since they are the closest match to the wires on the 21g Servo.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_3736.JPEG" alt="Slip Ring" width=600>

Remove the 2 small screws on the bottom of the 21g servo.  Replace the 3 wires with wires from the shortened end
of the slip ring.  Keep the removed wires and connector.  We will solder those onto the other end of the slip ring
wires later.

<b>NOTE: If you are uncomfortable with unsoldering the wires and replacing them on such a small circuit board,
then just cut the wires on the servo and solder the slip ring wires outside the servo case.  Make sure to cover
joints with heat shrink tubing.</b>

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_37xx.JPEG" alt="Servo" width=600>

Position the slip ring in the center hole and attach the 21g Servo to the Claw Servo Holder with the included screws
from the servo.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_37xx.JPEG" alt="Claw" width=600>

Attach the Claw Push Link to the Claw Arm Left with M2.6 x 6mm screw.  Attach both left and right Claw Arms to the
Claw assembly with M2.6 x 6mm screws.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_37xx.JPEG" alt="Claw" width=600>

Attach the Claw Attach to the Bucket Swing Arm and Bucket Push Link with M2.6 x 6mm screws.
Attach the claw assembly to the Claw Atach with M2.6 x 6mm screws.

Route the servo wires through the Dipper and Boom.  Solder original wires to slip ring cables and cover with
heat shrink tubing.  Connect Claw servo to circuit board.

<h3>Cab Main Body</h3>

Route LED with LED holder through Cab.  Connect both wires to a JST-XH connector.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_3717.JPEG" alt="Slip Ring" width=600>

Click Cab into lower body and plug lights into circuit board.

Attach Step to lower body with M2.6 x 6mm screw.

Attach Swivel to lower body with M2.6 x 6mm screws.  Attach Top Cover to Swivel with M2.6 x 6mm screws.

<img src="https://github.com/swholmstead/Excavator/blob/main/pictures/IMG_37xx.JPEG" alt="Cab and Top Cover" width=600>

Attach Exhaust Pipe to Engine Cover with M2.6 x 6mm screw.  Click Engine Cover onto Top Cover.
