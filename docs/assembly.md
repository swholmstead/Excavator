Insert Wheel Motor assembly into Track Support Left. Secure with Motor Lock Left and a M2.6 x 6mm screw.  I like to make sure
positive (+) end of battery is on top.  It makes it easier for soldering later.

Insert Wheel Idler on other end of Track Support Left and secure with M2.6 x 8mm screws.  Make sure screws are loose enough
for idler wheel to rotate freely.

Insert 2 Track Roller Uppers and 2 Track Roller Lowers onto Track Support Left and secure with M2.6 x 6mm screws.  Make sure
that all rollers can rotate freely.
