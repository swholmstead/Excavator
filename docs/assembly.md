Insert Wheel Motor assembly into Track Support Left. Secure with Motor Lock Left and a M2.6 x 6mm screw.  I like to make sure
positive (+) end of battery is on top.  It makes it easier for soldering later.

Insert Wheel Idler on other end of Track Support Left and secure with M2.6 x 8mm screws.  Make sure screws are loose enough
for idler wheel to rotate freely.

Insert 2 Track Roller Uppers and 2 Track Roller Lowers onto Track Support Left and secure with M2.6 x 6mm screws.  Make sure
that all rollers can rotate freely.

Repeat same steps for Track Support Right.

Attach Lower Frame between left and right track supports and secure with M2.6 x 8mm screws.  Ensure that the wire channel faces towards
the rear with the N20 100 rpm motors.

Insert the 12.5mm slip ring into the base of the Lower Frame.  Cover with Slip Ring Lock and secure with M2.6 x 8mm screws.  Route a pair
of wires to each motor.  Cut to length and solder wires to motors.
